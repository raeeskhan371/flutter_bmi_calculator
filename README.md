# Flutter BMI Calculator

This is my first Flutter project where I created a simple BMI Calculator.  
It allows users to input weight and height, and calculates BMI with a message about health status.

## ✨ Features
- Weight input (kg)
- Height input (ft + inches)
- BMI calculation
- Health status indicator (Underweight, Healthy, Overweight)
